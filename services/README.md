# CADdrive Services

This folder contains additional services required by the CADdrive platform such as **CodeAster** for finite element analysis (FEA), **OpenFOAM** for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and **ParaView** for visualization of simulation results.

## Services

The following diagram provides an overview of the services included in CADdrive.
For each service the port number and the HTTP route handlers are included.
Furthermore, the diagram shows the interactions between the different services.
Note that the interactions are implemented as HTTP requests and responses.
